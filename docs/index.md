# ARIA AI Agents

Welcome to the **ARIA AI Agents** documentation site! ARIA (Autonomous Responsive Intelligent Agent) is an advanced AI agent framework designed to create and manage autonomous AI agents. It provides a flexible and powerful system for building, deploying, and orchestrating AI agents for various applications.

## Documentation Structure

We follow the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/) to organize content into four main sections:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md) – Step-by-step guides to get started with ARIA  
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md) – Practical guides for specific ARIA tasks  
3. [Reference](reference.md) – Technical reference for ARIA’s APIs and components  
4. [Explanation](explanation.md) – Conceptual guides about ARIA’s architecture and design

For **code examples**, **API references**, and **prompt references**, refer to the dedicated pages:

- [Code Examples](code.md)
- [API Reference](api/) – (Files located in `docs/api/`)
- [Prompt Reference](yaml/) – (Files located in `docs/yaml/`)

Quickly find what you’re looking for by using the navigation links on top or in the sidebar.

## Project Overview

ARIA simplifies creating and managing AI agents by providing:

> 🚀 **Multiple AI Models**: Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLMs.  
> ⚙️ **Modular Architecture**: Plug and play new connectors (Discord, Twitter, Telegram, etc.) with minimal effort.  
> 🔗 **Prompt Chaining**: Build, modify, and chain prompts to accomplish complex tasks.  
> 🧠 **Memory & Templates**: Store persistent context and quickly adapt to different use cases. [WIP]  
> 📊 **CLI**: Monitor and manage agent interactions in real-time.
