This site contains the project documentation for
`AVA AI Agents`, an advanced AI agent framework designed to
create and manage autonomous AI agents. AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assistant)
provides a flexible and powerful system for building, deploying, and
orchestrating AI agents for various applications.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md) - Step-by-step guides to get started with AVA
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md) - Practical guides for specific AVA tasks
3. [Reference](reference.md) - Technical reference for AVA's APIs and components
4. [Explanation](explanation.md) - Conceptual guides about AVA's architecture

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.

## Project Overview

AVA is designed to simplify the creation and management of AI agents,
providing:

- A flexible agent architecture
- Built-in memory and reasoning capabilities
- Tool integration framework
- Multi-agent communication
- Customizable behaviors and goals

## Acknowledgements
