# ARAI AI Agents

Welcome to the **ARAI AI Agents** documentation site! ARAI (Autonomous Responsive Intelligent Agent) is an advanced AI agent framework designed to create and manage autonomous AI agents. It provides a flexible and powerful system for building, deploying, and orchestrating AI agents for various applications.

## Project Overview

ARAI simplifies creating and managing AI agents by providing:

> 🚀 **Multiple AI Models**: Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLMs.  
> ⚙️ **Modular Architecture**: Plug and play new connectors (Discord, Twitter, Telegram, etc.) with minimal effort.  
> 🔗 **Prompt Chaining**: Build, modify, and chain prompts to accomplish complex tasks.  
> 🧠 **Memory & Templates**: Store persistent context and quickly adapt to different use cases. [WIP]  
> 📊 **CLI**: Monitor and manage agent interactions in real-time.
