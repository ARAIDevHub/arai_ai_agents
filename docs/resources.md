  Quick reference for common commands (create envs, install packages, etc.).

- **Practical Tips**  
  1. `conda create --name myenv python=3.9` – Create a new environment.  
  2. `conda activate myenv` – Activate the new environment.  
  3. `conda install numpy` – Install a package into the active environment.
