Welcome to **ARAI AI Agents** – a Python-based system for managing AI agents, their interactions, and associated connectors. This project is designed to streamline the setup of multi-agent workflows and help developers easily integrate different language models, connectors, and prompt-chaining strategies.

---

> **Highlights**  
> 🚀 **Multiple AI Models**: Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLMs.  
> ⚙️ **Modular Architecture**: Plug and play new connectors (Discord, Twitter, Telegram, etc.) with minimal effort.  
> 🔗 **Prompt Chaining**: Build, modify, and chain prompts to accomplish complex tasks.  
> 🧠 **Memory & Templates**: Store persistent context and quickly adapt to different use cases. [WIP]  
> 📊 **CLI**: Monitor and manage agent interactions in real-time.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/arai-ai/arai_ai_agents.git

# 2. Move into the project directory
cd arai_ai_agents

# 3. Create a virtual environment (conda example)
conda create --name arai_ai_agents python=3.11
conda activate arai_ai_agents

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Run the main script
cd arai_ai_agents
python main.py
```

This will launch the **main** application, which initializes your agents, connectors, and any configured prompt-chaining logic.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arai-ai/arai_ai_agents.git
   ```
2. **Navigate** to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd arai_ai_agents
   ```
3. **Create** a virtual environment (e.g., using `conda`):
   ```bash
   conda create --name arai_ai_agents python=3.11
   conda activate arai_ai_agents
   ```
4. **Install** dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Run** the main script:
   ```bash
   cd arai_ai_agents
   python main.py
   ```
6. You should see a welcome prompt similar to:

   ```plaintext
   === Main Menu ===
   Welcome to ARAI Agents.
   Please select an option:

   Current Agent: None

   = Agent Management =
   1. Select an existing Agent
   2. Create a new Agent

   = Media Management =
   3. Create a new Season
   4. Create Season posts

   = Scheduler Management =
   5. Start Scheduler
   6. Check posting status
   7. Force post now
   8. Pause/Resume posting

   = Miscellaneous =
   9. Exit

   Enter your choice (1-9):
   ```

7. See the [CLI Guide](docs/cli-guide.md) for more information on how to use the CLI.

---

## Usage

You can programmatically work with the **ARAI AI Agents** from within your own Python scripts. For example:

```python
from arai_ai_agents.models.gemini_model import GeminiModel
from arai_ai_agents.connectors.twitter_connector import TwitterConnector

# 1. Initialize an AI model
model = GeminiModel()

# 2. Generate a response
response = model.generate_response("What is the weather in San Francisco?")

# 3. Print the response
print(response)

# 4. (Optional) Initialize a connector
twitter_conn = TwitterConnector()

# 5. (Optional) Post the response to Twitter
twitter_conn.post_to_twitter(response)

```

Depending on your project design, you might:
- Create or load multiple agents.
- Manage different connectors (Discord, Slack, Telegram, etc.).
- Use a prompt-chaining manager to orchestrate complex LLM calls.

For Prompt Chaining:
 - Look at the Prompt Chaining folder for python files that implement ARAI unique prompt chaining logic.
 - Step 1: Creates a new agent with a character background..
 - Step 2: Creates the seasons and episodes for the agent, this is how unique content is created.
 - Step 3: Creates the posts based off the agent and season/episode that the agent will post to the connector.

## Project Structure

Here’s how your folders and files are organized inside `arai_ai_agents/`. The main entry point is **`main.py`**, and each folder handles a different piece of functionality:

```bash
arai_ai_agents/
├─ __pycache__/          # Compiled Python files (ignore in version control)
├─ auth/                 # Authentication or credential management for connectors
├─ configs/              # GeneratedYAML/JSON config files for agents for posting content to connectors.
├─ connectors/           # Modules to connect with external services (Twitter, Discord, Slack, etc.)
├─ models/               # Model interfaces (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
├─ prompt_chaining/      # Logic and utilities for chaining prompts together
├─ prompts/              # Collections of prompt templates for the agents to use.
├─ templates/            # Templates used for the AI to fill in for the based on prompts chaining  .
├─ utils/                # Utility/helper functions shared across modules
├─ __init__.py           # Makes `arai_ai_agents` a Python package
└─ main.py               # Entry point to initialize and run the system
```

> **Tip**: You might place environment variables or secrets in `.env` files (not shown here). This keeps secret keys and tokens out of your codebase.

## Environment Variables

Many components require environment variables. For example, your Google Gemini API key, Twitter API keys, or other service credentials. A typical `.env` file could look like:

```bash
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=...
TWITTER_API_KEY=...
TWITTER_API_SECRET=...
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=...
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=...
```

> **Remember**: Don’t commit your `.env` file to source control if it contains secrets!
