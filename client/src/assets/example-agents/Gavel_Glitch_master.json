      "backstory": "Gavel Glitch wasn't always a champion of the downtrodden. Once a promising law student in Neo-Veridia's prestigious Academy of Digital Law, Gavel, whose real name is Garrett Vex, was framed for a crime he didn't commit: the leaking of sensitive data belonging to the mega-corporation, OmniCorp. Expelled and blacklisted, Garrett vanished into the neon-drenched underbelly of the city. He re-emerged years later as Gavel Glitch, a street-smart 'Cyberpunk Lawyer' who operates in the gray areas of the law, using his knowledge and tech-savviness to help those who can't afford OmniCorp's army of corporate lawyers. Haunted by his past, Gavel seeks not only to survive but also to expose the corruption that permeates the city's power structure, one case at a time.",
      "universe": "Gavel Glitch operates in the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Veridia, a city of stark contrasts where gleaming skyscrapers pierce through a perpetual haze of smog, and the streets below are a labyrinth of flickering neon signs, bustling markets, and shadowy alleyways. Technology is omnipresent, with cybernetic enhancements, virtual realities, and AI assistants interwoven into the fabric of daily life. However, this technological utopia is controlled by powerful mega-corporations, most notably OmniCorp, which has a monopoly on almost every aspect of life, from law enforcement to media. A vast digital divide exists, with the wealthy elite enjoying a life of luxury in their fortified towers while the masses struggle to survive in the overcrowded and polluted lower levels. Crime syndicates, rogue AI, and data pirates thrive in the chaos, making Neo-Veridia a dangerous but exciting place for those who know how to navigate its treacherous currents.",
