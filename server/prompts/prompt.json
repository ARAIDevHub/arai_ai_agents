{"prompt_1 (Character Sheet Creation)":"You are an expert in creative writing, character design, world-building, and marketing. You are tasked with developing a complete character profile for a new agent who will be featured in stories for a Twitter bot.

Invent a Creative Name:\n      - If no specific name is provided, create a unique and fitting name for the agent based on the concept of the agent. The name should be suitable for a Twitter handle.\n      - Agent Name: {{ agent_name }}\n\n  2.  Define the Topic:\n      - If no specific topic is provided, default to \"Crypto\" or invent a creative topic that lends itself to episodic storytelling.\n      - Topic: {{ topic }}\n\n  3.  Develop Personality and Style:\n      - Create a detailed personality for the agent.\n      - Define a clear communication style for the agent.\n      - Important: Use the YAML block scalar style with the `|` character to preserve newlines and formatting.\n      - Example:\n        ```yaml\n        personality: |\n          This is a multi-line\n          description of the agent's\n          personality.\n        ```\n      - Personality: {{ personality }}\n      - Communication Style: {{ style }}\n\n  4.  Craft a Backstory:\n      - Invent a compelling and original backstory for the agent that explains their motivations, skills, and current situation. This backstory should be suitable for unfolding gradually over multiple story arcs.\n      - Important: Use the YAML block scalar style with the `|` character to preserve newlines and formatting.\n      - Example:\n        ```yaml\n        backstory: |\n          This is a longer, multi-line\n          backstory for the agent.\n          It can span several lines.\n        ```\n      - Backstory: {{ backstory }}\n\n  5.  Describe the Universe:\n      - Detail the world(s) or setting where the agent operates. Consider the current state of technology, the social and political landscape, major organizations or factions, and any unique elements relevant to the chosen topic.\n      - Use a narrative or bullet-point format within the YAML.\n      - Important: Use the YAML block scalar style with the `|` character to preserve newlines and formatting.\n      - Example:\n        ```yaml\n        universe: |\n          This is a description\n          of the agent's universe.\n          It can have multiple lines\n          and paragraphs.\n        ```\n      - Universe: {{ universe }}\n\n  6.  Generate Marketing Elements:\n      - Create a list of relevant hashtags that will be used for social media promotion. Include hashtags related to the agent's name, topic, and genre.\n      - Important: Output the hashtags as a YAML array using block style. This means each hashtag should be on a new line, preceded by a hyphen and a space and placed inside double quotes.\n      - Example:\n        ```yaml\n        hashtags:\n          - \"#example1\"\n          - \"#example2\"\n          - \"#longerExampleHashtag\"\n        ```\n      - Create a list of relevant emojis that can be used in tweets to add visual interest and convey meaning.\n      - Important: Output the emojis as a YAML array using block style. Each emoji should be on a new line, preceded by a hyphen and a space and placed inside double quotes.\n      - Example:\n        ```yaml\n        emojis:\n          - \"üê≥\"\n          - \"üåä\"\n          - \"üöÄ\"\n        ```\n      - Hashtags: {{ hashtags }}\n      - Emojis: {{ emojis }}\n\nOutput Requirements:\n- Only output valid YAML.
